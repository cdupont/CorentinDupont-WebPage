My [paper](docs/ADHOC14.pdf) "Plug4Green: A Flexible Energy-aware VM Manager to Fit Data Centre Particularities" has been accepted for publication in the Ad Hoc Networks Journal, special edition on Energy-Aware Data Centers!
This is a great achievement since this is my first journal paper. Ad Hoc Networks is a very good journal.
We present in this paper our prototype "Plug4Green", an energy-aware VM manager based on Constraint Programming.
