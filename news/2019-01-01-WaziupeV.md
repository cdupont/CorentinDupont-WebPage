With a couple of long-date friends, we gathered in Dresden to launch a new initiative called Waziup e.V.
[WAZIUP e.V](http://www.waziup.org) is a non-profit organization promoting cutting-edge technologies and capacity building toward emerging countries.
We are engaged in IoT capacity building for startups and entrepreneurs via bootcamps, workshops and hackathons; enabling them to build low-cost and innovative IoT products.
Whish us luck!
