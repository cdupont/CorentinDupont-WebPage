I attended [BigDat 2015](http://grammars.grlmc.com/bigdat2015/), a winter school on big data.
The subject is popular (and vaguely defined sometime), it was packed with students. Some of the courses that most interrested me: big data programming (Hadoop, Spark, Storm), big data visualization, social networks.
