title: Paper accepted at E2DC 2014
---

My [paper](docs/E2DC14.pdf) "Building Application Profiles to Allow a Better Usage of the Renewable Energies in Data Centres" has been accepted at the workshop E2DC 2014 (colocated with E-Energy conference)! 
In fact I will present it this very afternoon in Cambridge, UK.
I'm getting used to this workshop and conference since it's the third time I'm attending :)
