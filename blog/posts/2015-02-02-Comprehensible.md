As Einstein said, "The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that it is comprehensible".
But is it really comprehensible?

Let's suppose that the Universe is, at the end, a sort of athematical structure ([as supposed by Max Tegmark](http://www.amazon.com/Our-Mathematical-Universe-Ultimate-Reality/dp/0307599809)).
The question is, can we know this structure?
That would mean that this mathematical structure allows to contain a description of itself, written in its own "language".
As Humans, we are a part of this structure.
If we understand this structure, that means that we have a description of it inside our brain.
Our brain is a physical object, and any information inside it is encoded as physical processes.
*In fine*, this description is encoded in terms of the fundamental structure itself.

Is it possible? Does mathematical structures that allow to encode a complete description of themselves do really exist?
This seems to be a very GÃ¶delian question!
