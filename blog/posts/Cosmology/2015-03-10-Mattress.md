![Bowling ball on a mattress](/images/mattress.jpeg)

When describing general relativity, this image is often coming up: imagine a mattress, and a bowling ball on it.
The bowling ball is like a planet, and the mattress is the space.
It's visible that the bowling is curving the mattress: any marble launched nearby will roll toward the ball.
This image has its benefits, but it's misleading for several reasons:

1. The mattress shouldn't even exist before the marble is launched.
2. The gravity shouldn't deform the mattress/spacetime: the gravity *is* the mattress/spacetime.
3. The mattress "geometry" should be deformed as much as to make a previously straight line on it to circle around the "planet".
4. Finally, this analogy is involving gravity to explain gravity... Doesn't feel right.


Points 3. and 4. are more technical/pedagogical problems, but 1. and 2. are more fundamental.
Indeed our old "Newtonian" vision was that the spacetime pre-exists to things: the space and the time was like an immutable arena.
The objects exist and move in this arena.
the space and the time was outside the Universe and was used to measure the position and the moment of events, without being affected by them.
The gravity was a force, and with its little arms it would pull objects together.

There is no mattress
====================

Einstein's theories broke this vision: the space and the time are now part of the world and are affected by the things in it.
However the mattress vision is not radical enough.
Indeed it's not a big mental step to say: "OK, the gravity is not anymore pulling objects directly together with its little arms, but now it is bending an intermediate thing which is the spacetime".
In fact, as stated by 1. and 2., the mattress/spacetime is not an intermediate pre-existing thing that would just be deformed by the Gravity: the spacetime *is* the gravity. They are the same thing.
In term of fields, the spacetime is the field of the gravity, just like the electromagnetic field is the field associated with electricity.

In the example of the moon circling the earth, the moon is always going straight... In a curved space.
However, the spacetime curvature is not the same for everybody: a photon leaving the moon on the same trajectory will not circle the earth as the moon is doing but instead go straight into space.
We all have our own "local" vision of spacetime!
