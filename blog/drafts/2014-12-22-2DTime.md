We always associate time with a one dimensional line, more or less like the Real number line.
But can time have more dimensions? 
In other words, are there simple mathematical structures that can be qualified to be "time-like" and have more than one dimension?
First of all, what qualifies a struture to be time-like?
Time is often associated with cause and consequences, causes "happening" before consequences on the time line.
So the moments in the time structure must be ordered, that is, a moment must always be "before" or "after" another.
This seems to disqualify higher-dimentional times, because then the moments could not be ordered, and bye-bye the cause-consequence relation.
For example, if time is 2D, is the moment (1,2) before or after the point (3,0)?
