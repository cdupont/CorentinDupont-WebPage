In this article, I will try to sumarize my thought on two important questions:
- Why is there homosexuality? 
- Why is there homophobia?

Homosexuality seems to have biological origins.
There are different theories about Homosexuality in Human.
Of course, if homosexuality can have a genetic origin, there cannot be a "gay gene".
As gay people tend to not have kids, this gene would be imediately eliminated.

The first is an *epigenetic* theory.
