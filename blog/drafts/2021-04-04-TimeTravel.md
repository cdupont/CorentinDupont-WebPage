A time travelling game


Time travelling is a recurring theme in movies and games.
The problem of time travel is that it creates paradoxes...
The mere option of time travelling is already a paradox.
Say, that something happened in the past, that you would like to change.
For example, your fiancee died in an accident...
So, you build a time machine, go back in the past and prevent her from dying.
In this case, your fiancee is alive, and you don't need to time travel anymore!
So the motivation for time travelling itself is compromised.
The simple act of time travelling introduces paradoxes, even if you refrain yourself from doing *anything* in the past.
You can stay well hidden, not interact with anything, especially not with yourself...
There will be paradoxes. By simply being there, existing, breathing, that will have rippling consequences that will break causality at some point.
For instance, the miro-organisms that you breath in will be killed, and maybe not be able to father the same micro-organisms that you brought on you skin.
Heck, even the photons emitted by your body will interact with the environment.
After a long chain of atomic-level interactions, this initial radiation will modify very subtly the status of particle from you future self, at the moment of entering the time machine.
This might prevent some of the photons to be emitted in the first place.
Even your impact on the local gravity field will be changed, by your mere presence!

The only way to time travel with paradoxes is to also teleport *outside* your cone of light, preventing any possible interactions.
You'll be teleporting effectively in a completely different world.

Scenarists for movies always struggle with time travel paradox.
They always arise, in any time traveller movie: Terminator, Back to the Future...

There are different ways to solve those paradoxes in films: different timelines, "it has always been like that"...
See this video.

Time travel paradoxes arise in our world because there are too many parameters and too many causality chains.
It arises inevitably.
Time travel could be possible in a very simplified reality, with very few parameters.
Time travel may be possible at particles level. 
Particle are very simple objects, coming without "baggages": a particle have a few number of properties.
For example an electron have its mass, its charge...
But I'd says that an electron is not an obect *with* some properties, is it "defined by" its properties. 
It has nothing else, it is just a bunch of properties. Not baggages.
