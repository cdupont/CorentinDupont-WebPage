I do believe that time, as well as space, are emergent phenomenas of a more primitive phenomena.
To make a parallel with another emergent phenomena, take the temperature: at our level, temperature do exist, we can feel it, we can measure it.
It's an important and interesting parameter in many situations.
But at a lower level, it doesn't exist anymore: there is only molecular agitation.
For time and space, this is probably the same: those two "emerge" and unfolds from more fundamental things.
