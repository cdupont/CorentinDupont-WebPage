title: Is Math invented or discovered?

It's a very old question of course.
What is the difference between an invention and a discovery?
You invent something that doesn't exist already (like the Nuclear Powered Orange ), while you discover something that already exists (like discovering the Vanuatu Islands).
But in my opinion there is not a lot of difference between the two: an invention is the discovery of a possibility.
The fact that the same complicated piece of mathematics is re-invented by different people suggests that mathematics is discovered in an even stronger sense than a mere possibility.
The real mystery is why and how this happens.
In other words, why is the the realm of mathematical possibilities so constrained?
