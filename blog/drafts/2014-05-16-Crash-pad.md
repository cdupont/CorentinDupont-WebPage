Create haskell package to produce time line diagrams such as: http://xkcd.com/657/
http://vis.cs.ucdavis.edu/~tanahashi/storylines/

data ID = String
data Group = Set ID
data Groups = Set Group //IDs should be unique in a TimeFrameGroups.
data OrderedIDs = [ID] 

//Order the IDs so that to minimize the line crossings.
orderIDs :: [Groups] -> [ID]
