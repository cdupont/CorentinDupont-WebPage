![The Dimension-O-Meter](/images/dial.jpeg)

Let's build a special machine: a Dimension-O-Meter.
This is a sort of box (apparently), with button on the top and a dial on the front, with a big needle indicating some numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4...
When I press the button, the machine start buzzing loudly, indicating it is making all sort of measurements and calculations.
The needle then takes off and slowly stabilises on a number: 3.
Of course, if run in a different Universe, this machine could indicate a different number...

Well, this machine doesn't exists.
That's because the number of dimensions is not a measure.
It is said that our world have three apparent dimensions of space.
How can we be so sure of that?
