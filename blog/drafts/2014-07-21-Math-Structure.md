title: In which mathematical structure are we living?

Mark Tegmark suggests that the ultimate reality of the Universe is Math.
Specifically, it's a mathematical structure.
The Universe is existing just like a mathematical theorem is existing, no more, no less.
To me, arguing that the Universe, at its very bottom, is a mathematical structure is quite natural: after all, when searching for the essence of reality, the physician will look at each property of the universe and say: this property can be deduced form these others, so I can drop it as being non primitive.
Doing that, we are removing, layer by layer, properties that are non primitives.
Assuming that there is a finite number of properties, at the end all that remains will be a handfull of properties, coming "bare", without baggage as Max Tegmark puts it, that is to say without context.
And what is an object consisting of a bunch of properties without baggage?
A mathematical structure, of course!

When we think about math, we see some boring equations.
Actually those equation are not "math", just "mathematical language".
To many people, the mathematical language is special, quite magical and separate from other sciences.
To me, the math language is just a normal language: it is not more fundamentally powerful that any other common language.
The main property of the math language is its conciseness: each symbol as a precise meaning, so that you can buid complex sentences within only a little space.
It would be possible to write "Principia Mathematica", the 2000 pages book from Russell, in plain English, but well it would explode in size and being, finally, not humanly writable nor readable.
But when saying "The Universe is Math", we are not refering to the math language but to a mathematical structure.

It's facinating to see that when looking down to the infinite small, thing get more and more simple.
At our scale, the vocabulary necessary to describe the reality surrounding us is astoundingly big: think about the biology, politics, economics, weather and the associated theories, but also about love, films and novels around here...
But to describe the infinitely small, this vocabulary narrows down.
It narrows down to actually only 8 particules: XXX
In the same way, when looking up into the infinitely big, thinks simplifies: XXX

The multiverse solves two big questions: "Why is there something rather than nothing?" and consequently "If there is something, why this exactly and not something else?".
Indeed, let's imagine that you're a great physicist.
You invent a new theory, that explains very well the reality surrounding us.
What more, every experiment tend to confirm it.
However, there will always be someone that will come and tell you "Nice equation! It seems to decribe very well the reality. But why this one? Who chose??".
The multiverse solves this problem by removing it: nobody chose since all possible reality do exist.
Then why do we experiment this one in particular?
Because we are conscious into it!
Although all states of particles do exist in parralel universe according to the multiverse interpretation of quantum physics, the special state of mind called consciousness make me experience the world surrounding it only.

The mathematical structure we live in, yet undeciphered, does not have to evolve.
There is no notion of change nor time.
Our reality exists just like a mathematical theorem exists, no more no less.
A mathematical theorem exists because it is non-contradictory. 
We experience the world around us a physical because we are parts of this mathematical structure interacting with other parts of the same structure.
Furthemore, this mathematical structure includes all the space, all the time, of all parralel universes.
It is all, at once, why no evolution.
We experience one particular universe within the multiverse because of the consciousness.

I do believe that time, as well as space, are emergent phenomenas of more primitive phenomenas.
Indeed, temperature is an emergent phenomena: at our level, temperature do exist, we can feel it, we can measure it.
It's an important and interresting parameter in many situations.
But at a lower parameter, it doesn't exist anymore: there is only particule agitation.
For time and space, this is probably the same.

Most people have a hierarchical vision of the reality: each layer of reality is based on the underlying one.
For example, phycology is based on neurology, which is based on biology, chemistry and ultimately particle physics and quantum mechanics.
But in fact, whith the multiverse hypothesis, the oposite is also true: the laws of quantum mechanics are influenced, at least partially, by psychology.
Indeed, to be able to develop a thing such as consciousness, the base laws of our universe within the multiverse should be able to allow it.
Some of the fundamental parameters of our universe, such as the speed of light and the planck's constant, seem indeed very finely tuned so to allow our existence.
For example, if one constant would be 1 millionth greater or smaller, the atoms would not stick together, and no chemistry would exists, and even less Humans able to study it.
This is called the anthropic principle: to justify a fact in our universe by saying that if it was any different, we wouldn't be there to discuss it.
I believe that the anthropic principle is very fundamental in our universe.
