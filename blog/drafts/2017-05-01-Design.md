Humans have always looked special.
We often hear: this and this is a common law. Except for humans of course.

Genetics
There is only one type of non inteligent design: Darwinian evolution.
Its discovery sums up in 4 names: Mendel, Darwin, watson and crick.
Mendel discovered the principle of gene, by deduction.
Darwin discovered the principle of evolution of the species.
Finally watson and crick discovered the physico-chemical support for all this.

Memetics
Memetic is the recent science kf memes.
A meme is simply a small piece of culture.
This piece of culture can be memorized and transmitted.
That's enough to make it a meme!

Meme gene interactions

This is what makes humans so special.
We have not just one, but two replicators fighting: the gened and the memes.
The two are like the master and the dog. The genes are like the master, slow moving, and holding the dog with a long leesh.
