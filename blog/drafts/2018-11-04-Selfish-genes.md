How to survive your own death?
It turns out, you cannot (ah-ah!), but something from you can.

Our Selfish genes
-----------------

There is only one type of non inteligent design: Darwinian evolution.
Its discovery sums up in 4 names: Mendel, Darwin, Watson and Crick:

- Mendel discovered the principle of the genes, by deduction.
- Darwin discovered the principle of evolution of the species.
- Finally Watson and Crick discovered the physico-chemical support for all this.

Long before the DNA was discovered, Mendel unveiled the rules of heredity.
His famous experiments on pea plants showed him some significant statistics: breeding yellow pea and green pea always produced yellow seeds.
However, in the next generation, the green peas reappeared at a ratio of 1 green to 3 yellow!
Something was going on with the genes.
Darwin put this heredity in context when he published his famous book *On the Origin of Species*.
He showed that all species descended from a common ancestor, and that this evolution stems from a very simple principle: *natural selection*.
Finally Watson and Cricks discovered the true support of heredity and evolution: the DNA.
They identified, with others, the identity of the chemicals behind the DNA, and how they encode the characters of the living organisms.

Evolution only needs two things: a replicator, and time. 
This is how life appeared on earth: in primitive times, the oceans were filled with simple molecules like amino-acids.
Those amino-acids combined randomly, under the influence of external energy such as lightning or sun rays.
Those combinations fell appart rapidly, again under the influence of external energy.
However, at some point something extraordinary happened: out of complete randomness, how of those combinations happened to be something very special.
This special combination was a replicator.
A replicator is a molecule that as the very peculiar property to replicate itself.
It attracts other molecules from the environment and build automatically other copies of itself.

When this happened, the replicator quickly filled the primitive oceans, until depletion of precursor molecules.
This situation stabilized for a while, until one of the replicator made a mistake while copying itself.
This copy error, again out of sheer luck, happened to enhance the replicator: it was either faster to copy itself, or created more offsprings.
So it began to fill the oceans itself, replacing the previous replicator.
At this point, there was no turning back: evolution was quicked off.

Genes are immortal
------------------

We still have an old descendant of this primitive replicator in each of our cells: the DNA and its counterpart, the RNA.
Genes are really immortal: they travel through time, during millions of year, hoping from one individual to another.
As Richard Dawkins put it, we are really just the vehicules of our genes.
This long competition between the genes produced what we are: complex animals, striving at surviving and reproducing. 

So, one way to reach immortality is to make kids.
They will pass down something from you.
Seems underwhelming, right? 
But there is another way: to create some piece of cultural work.
This is the subject of our next blog post: the meme.
