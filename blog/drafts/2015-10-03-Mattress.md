![Bowling ball on a mattress](images/mattress.jpeg)

When describing general relativity, this image is often coming up: imagine a mattress, an a bowling ball on it.
The bowling ball is like a planet, and the mattress is the space.
It's visible that the bowling is curving the mattress: any marble launched nearby will incurve toward the ball.

This image has it's benefit, but it's misleading for several reasons.

* The mattress doesn't exists before the marble is launched
* The gravity doesn't deforms the mattress/spacetime, the gravity *is* the spacetime

Other limitations:
* The mattress doesn't deforms as much so as to make previously straight line circling the "planet"
* We use an example involving gravity to explain gravity... Doesn't feel right.
