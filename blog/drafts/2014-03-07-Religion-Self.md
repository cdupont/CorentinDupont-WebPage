[As Feynman put it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YltEym9H0x4), God is "too simple, too connected, too local, too provincial". In this interview, his main argument is about the "geographical" anthropocentrism of God: God came to earth, specificaly for us, while the whole Universe is so big. Why would God concentrate on human problems? I would like to bring two more arguments showing the tremendous anthropocentrism of God, which makes it non credible.

- Religion is an avatar of the development of the human mind.
No animal have a religion. 
The religion developped as a side effect of the development of the intelligence.
I can see two main reasons:
The first is the fear of death. Dead is an absurdity, it's unacceptable for the humain mind. 
It is absurd because it can appear to the human mind as a paradox.
As very often, this paradox can be shown as a self reference: you will never be able to say rightfully this sentence: "I am dead".
That's because the "I" of this sentence is the entity that is dead, as stated, but is also the person saying the sentence, which is not possible.
It is thus paradoxical, and makes it unconceivable.
To me, "I" was always alive. In this sentence, "I" and "me" are the same, and refer to the conciousness of a person.
A human is not born with a consiousness: it is something that appears around the age of 4-5 years old.
So you were not born "you": "you" only appeared gradually. 
"I" never experienced death, and will never be able to (as I won't be able to whitness me own death).

As such, religion fills this semantic gap by promissing an afterlife: when I'll die, "I" will not be really dead: "I" will go to paradize.
It is thus resolving a tension provoked by the paradox.

The second reason that makes God not believable, to my point of view, is that it fills another psychological hole of Humans:
the lost of the family cocoon.
Childs naturally have a magical understanding of the world.
When you are a child, you live in a magical world under the protection of your parents.
Whatever you will do, that will be a providential entity, your parents, that will be there to repair.
But soon, you will discover that this will not be always possible: when turning into teenage, and even more as an adult, you will have to live alone and respond for your actions.
This lost of the magical family cocoon is what God has got to replace.
We call God "our Father" in a traditional song: "Our Father, who art in heaven".
The function of God as a replacement of the lost father, which is above and protecting us is clear.

So, all in all, religion is way too much shaped to fill holes of the human psychology and developmenet to be credible.
More and more modern countries are becoming less religious.
I was raised as a Catholic, but at a certain age I began to question that.
This has been a bereavement.
Giving up religion is a bereavement: what you loose is a lot of confort.
It is terrible to be an atheist: life is absurd, there is no reason why I am here and it is even more absurd to die.
I think the current evolution of society, where religion is progressively diseappearing, is more or less like an adolescent crisis.
We are giving up the old belief, and the shelter they provided, because our intelligence became strong enough to live with the incertainty and the absurdity.

This is also the reason I don't like to discuss about religion with very religious people. I am under the impression I am hurting them: religion is like a confortable cocoon. Criticizing the religion is like taking away the cocoon from them: they will inevitably fight back for it. They will find any argument, no matter how absurd, to defend it. No reasonable discussion can take place.
