Presentation

My career path is a bit atypical. In three lines: 

* I have worked in the industry for 7 years in France for clients such as the French Navy (DCNS), EADS, Thales and PSA PEUGEOT CITROEN. 
* In 2010, I re-oriented my career toward research and moved to Italy, to work on topic such as Cloud Computing and Internet of Things in the research centre Create-Net. 
* I have also completed a PhD in Computer Science in 2016 with the University of Trento, Italy.

Research overview
-----------------

My research interests are around resource optimization in data centres, functional programming and constraint programming.

I am part of these EU FP7/H2020 projects:

* [WaziHub](http://wazihub.com): Accelerating IoT and Big Data innovation in Africa.  
* [Waziup](http://waziup.eu): Open Innovation Platform for IoT and Big-Data in Sub-Saharan Africa.  
* [DC4Cities](http://projects.dc4cities.eu/): better use of renewable energies (solar, wind, hydro) in data centres.  
* [iCore](http://www.iot-icore.eu/): use cognitive technologies to adress the heterogeneity of the vast amount of object interconnected in the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm.

See my [pages/research.html](research page<) for other projects,
or my {pages/publications.html](publications page) for a list of papers.
