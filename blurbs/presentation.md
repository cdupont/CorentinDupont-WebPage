My career path is a bit atypical. In three lines: 

* I have worked in the industry for 7 years in France for clients such as the French Navy (DCNS), EADS, Thales and PSA PEUGEOT CITROEN. 
* In 2010, I re-oriented my career toward research and moved to Italy, to work on topic such as Cloud Computing and Internet of Things in the research centre Create-Net. 
* I have also completed a PhD in Computer Science in 2016 with the University of Trento, Italy.
