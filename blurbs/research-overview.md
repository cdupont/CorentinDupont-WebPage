I am currently part of these EU FP7 projects:

* [DC4Cities](http://projects.dc4cities.eu/): better use of renewable energies (solar, wind, hydro) in data centres.  
* [iCore](http://www.iot-icore.eu/): use cognitive technologies to adress the heterogeneity of the vast amount of object interconnected in the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm.
