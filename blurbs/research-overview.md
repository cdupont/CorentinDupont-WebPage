---

My research interests are around resource optimization in data centres, functional programming and constraint programming.

I am part of these EU FP7/H2020 projects:

* [WaziHub](http://wazihub.com): Accelerating IoT and Big Data innovation in Africa.  
* [Waziup](http://waziup.eu): Open Innovation Platform for IoT and Big-Data in Sub-Saharan Africa.  
* [DC4Cities](http://projects.dc4cities.eu/): better use of renewable energies (solar, wind, hydro) in data centres.  
* [iCore](http://www.iot-icore.eu/): use cognitive technologies to adress the heterogeneity of the vast amount of object interconnected in the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm.
